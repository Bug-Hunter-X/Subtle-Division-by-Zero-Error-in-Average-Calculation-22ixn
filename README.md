This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in Python code: the silent failure of division by zero.  The `calculate_average` function attempts to calculate the average of a list of numbers. While it correctly handles an empty list, it does not explicitly check for non-numeric elements within the list, leading to a `TypeError` if such elements are present. The solution provided addresses this by robustly handling potential errors. This example highlights the importance of input validation and error handling for robust and reliable code.
